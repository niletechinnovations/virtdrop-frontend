                <li><strong> BINDING ARBITRATION</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Website (each, a &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT&rsquo;S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS&rsquo; Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS&rsquo; rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator&rsquo;s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent TEXQUE from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect TEXQUE&rsquo;s proprietary interests.</p>
                <ol start="13">
                <li><strong> CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
                <ol start="14">
                <li><strong> MISCELLANEOUS</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the Termination provision above, such termination shall not affect the validity of the following provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect: &ldquo;Intellectual Property,&rdquo; &ldquo;Communications to TEXQUE,&rdquo; &ldquo;No Warranties/Limitation of Liability,&rdquo; &ldquo;Indemnification,&rdquo; &ldquo;Termination of the Agreement,&rdquo; &ldquo;Compliance with Applicable Laws,&rdquo; &ldquo;Binding Arbitration,&rdquo; &ldquo;Class Action Waiver,&rdquo; &ldquo;Equitable Relief,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Miscellaneous.&rdquo; You may not assign this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of laws. Except for proceedings commenced by TEXQUE to protect its intellectual property or confidential information which may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties mutually agree that any and all disputes arising hereunder shall be resolved exclusively by state or federal courts located in the State of New York. Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all existing agreements and all other oral, written or other communication between the parties concerning the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.</p>
