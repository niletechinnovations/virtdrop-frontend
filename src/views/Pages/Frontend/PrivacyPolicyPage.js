                <p><em>Last updated: February 20, 2020</em></p>
                <p>VirDrop and the company whose branding is displayed on the website ("<strong>Site</strong>") and/or mobile application ("<strong>Application</strong>") that links to this Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Branded Company</strong>") respect the privacy of Site and Application (collectively, "<strong>Services</strong>") users.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of the policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any personal information that VirDrop collects from or about users in connection with the Services. VirDrop provides the Services to users on behalf of the Branded Company, as a service provider and data processor. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, mobile applications or other online services that do not link to this policy, including other services provided by the Branded Company. To the extent VirDrop shares personal information with the Branded Company as this Privacy Policy describes, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Branded Company&rsquo;s subsequent use of that information.</p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS AND PRIVACY SHIELD</strong></p>
                <p>If you are a non-U.S. user of the Services, by using the Services and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed outside the country in which it was collected, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you acknowledge such transfer.</p>
                <p>VirDrop complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the EU and/or Switzerland.</p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>THE TYPES OF INFORMATION VirDrop COLLECTS</strong></p>
                <p>VirDrop collects information from you in various ways when you access or use the Services. VirDrop collect personal information from you in the following ways:</p>
                <p>(a) Personal Information You Provide to Us. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>VirDrop may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, address, e-mail, telephone number and when you create an account ("<strong>Account</strong>").</li>
                  <li>The Services allow you to store preferences such as your location, recent orders and favorite menu items in order to make it more convenient for you to place additional orders in the future.</li>
                  <li>When you order menu items from the Branded Company on our Services, VirDrop will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name and payment information. VirDrop may store this information on our servers, in order to make it easier for you to place orders for the Branded Company&rsquo;s menu items in the future. VirDrop does not store your payment information on our servers but stores a secure "token" that helps facilitate a secure payment transaction on the Branded Company Services.</li>
                  <li>If you provide feedback or contact VirDrop via email, VirDrop will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.</li>
                  <li>VirDrop also collects other types of personal information that you provide voluntarily, such as any information requested by VirDrop if you contact VirDrop via email regarding support for the Services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(b) Personal Information Collected Via Technology. VirDrop collects certain information from you automatically when you access and use the Services as described below:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Information Collected by our Servers. To make the Services more useful to you, VirDrop servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including the referring/exit pages, your browser type, domain name, date/time stamp for your visit and your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or device when you use the Internet). VirDrop uses this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, monitor for fraudulent activities using fraud management tools, and better tailor the Services to users&rsquo; needs.</li>
                  <li>Like many online services, VirDrop uses cookies to collect information on the Sites. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. VirDrop may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Sites. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor your experience with the Services to meet your special interests and needs.</li>
                  <li>Mobile Services. We may also collect information from your mobile device if you have downloaded a Branded Company&rsquo;s Application. This information is generally used to help deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your general geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event the Application crashes your mobile device, VirDrop will receive information about your mobile device model, software version and device carrier, to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of the Application. This information is sent to VirDrop as aggregated information. The aggregated information is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.</li>
                  <li>Third Party Analytics. VirDrop uses third party service providers to help analyze how users use the Services ("Analytics Companies"). These Analytics Companies use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. VirDrop uses the information we get from these Analytics Companies to improve the Services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(c) Facebook and other Social Networking Services. The Services may allow users to access Facebook and other social networking sites (each, an "SNS") to interact with and share their experiences with the Branded Company&rsquo;s products and services with their friends. If you are not a registered user of the Services, you can create an Account by clicking on "Sign In" using Facebook or another SNS that we support, and then entering your SNS login credentials. In this case, VirDrop may receive information from Facebook or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Services. Once you register on the Services and connect with Facebook or another SNS, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other SNS. The information that your Facebook or other SNS account provides to VirDrop may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS&rsquo;s privacy and data practices.</p>
                <p>(d) Location Information. If you have enabled location services on your phone and agree to the collection of your location when prompted by the Services, VirDrop will collect your location information when you use the Services; for example, to locate those restaurants and locations of the Branded Company that are near you or when you "check in" via the Services. If you do not want VirDrop to collect this information, you may decline the collection of your location when prompted or adjust the location services settings on your device.</p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>HOW VirDrop USES YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
                <p>(a) General Use. In general, VirDrop uses your personal information to respond to your requests as submitted through the Services, to provide you the Services you request, or to help serve you better. VirDrop uses your personal information in the following ways:</p>

                  <li>send surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to the Services at the Branded Company&rsquo;s request or direction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(b) Creation of Anonymous Data.

                <p>(d) Corporate Restructuring. VirDrop may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of VirDrop business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset. If VirDrop company, business or assets is acquired by another company, that company will possess the personal information collected by VirDrop and the company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>(e) Social Networking Sites ("SNS"). VirDrop Application and Services may enable you to post content to SNSs (e.g. Facebook and Twitter).

                <p>(f) Other Disclosures. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your personal information, VirDrop may disclose your personal information if VirDrop believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on VirDrop; (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of VirDrop, the Branded Company or users of the Services; (c) in connection with a legal investigation; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or VirDrop Terms of Use.</p>

                <p><strong>NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA USERS</strong></p>
                <p>We are providing this supplemental privacy notice to California users on behalf of the Branded Company, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"). Please note that as a service provider handling personal information on behalf of the Branded Company, VirDrop is not required to provide a CCPA notice.

                <p>The Branded Company is prohibited from selling personal information through the VirDrop Services. As set out in this Privacy Policy, we, our service providers and partners use cookies and other tracking technologies to analyze website traffic and facilitate advertising.

                </ul>
                <p>Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting businesses from providing&nbsp;</p>
                <p>certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which&nbsp;</p>
                <p>they must comply with a deletion request.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Here is how you can submit requests:&nbsp;</p>

                  <li><strong>Identity verification</strong>. CCPA requires verification of the identity of the individual submitting the request. For identity verification requirements, visit the Branded Company&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;</li>
